					<em>I&apos;m passionate about tech!</em> You&apos;ve probably heard
					this, way too may times; but I&apos;m not just passionate about tech
					itself, I am very curious about what tech can doâ€” how much can we
					achieve using tech? And this was what intrigued and brought me to ECO.
					<br />
					My approach to learning is to actively build projects. I love to build
					stuff, to go behind the scene and understand how the tool works...

				<h5 className={Styles.sectionHeading}>I love to write</h5>
				<p className={Styles.sectionTxt}>
					Over the years, technical writing has provided a way for me to go
					deeper into any topic, and satisfy my curiousity about that tool,
					while also sharing the knowledge with others.

					<em>It&apos;s always a win-win-win! (~_^)</em>
